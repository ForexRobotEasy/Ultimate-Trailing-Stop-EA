## Description

The Ultimate Trailing Stop EA is designed to manage open orders by applying a trailing stop to them. It iterates through all open orders and applies the trailing stop based on certain conditions.

## Features

- Trailing stop functionality for open orders
- Supports both buy and sell orders
- Advanced filtering options

## Usage

To use this EA, follow these steps:

1. Install the EA on your MetaTrader platform.
2. Set up the desired trailing stop parameters.
3. Run the EA and it will automatically manage your open orders.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called during EA initialization. This is where you can add any necessary initialization code. 

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during EA deinitialization. This is where you can add any necessary deinitialization code.

## Trading Logic

The `OnTick()` function is the main trading logic of the EA. It iterates through all open orders and applies the trailing stop based on certain conditions. 

- For buy orders, if the current stop loss is less than `Bid - OrderTakeProfit()`, a trailing stop is applied. The new stop loss is calculated as `Bid - OrderTakeProfit() - StopLevel()`. If the new stop loss is higher than the current stop loss, the order is modified.
- For sell orders, if the current stop loss is greater than `Ask + OrderTakeProfit()`, a trailing stop is applied. The new stop loss is calculated as `Ask + OrderTakeProfit() + StopLevel()`. If the new stop loss is lower than the current stop loss, the order is modified.
